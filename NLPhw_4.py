Extensive discussion of the activities of the subject of an article in multiple sources contribute to the notability of the subject. - - "\r\n" (suggested subification leaves only the current lede) or delete and salt. The article\'s history shows that it\'s both a fertile ground for SPAs and socks, and a huge time-sink for experienced editors. Wikipedia is under no onus to cover everything which there are reliable sources for (if indeed there are reliable sources) and undoubtedly the passage of time will make many of the current issues quibbled about redundant due to the appearance of multiple, high-quality secondary sources. I invite editors to consider the opportunity cost of their time editing wikipedia---are there really no other articles can should focusing on? "\r\n" ""a fertile ground for SPAs and socks"" not exactly a policy based argument is it? Nor is ""a huge time-sink for experienced editors"". ""if indeed there are reliable sources"" ""due to the appearance of multiple, high-quality secondary sources"" as at least 4 high quality secondary sources have been given it seems you are making a proposal without even bothering to look at the references given. ""are there really no other articles can should focusing on?"" you are welcome to work on whatever articles you choose as is any editor, perhaps since you haven\'t checked the given references or presented arguments your efforts are better directed elsewhere. Pardon the low level of civility, but after giving references, having them dismissed and providing detailed information on several references, ""if indeed there are reliable sources"" is dismissive and shows a proposal made without consideration. Best. - - "\r\n" with Bernard Rimland, who is clearly more notable than the institute he founded. "\r\n" and redirect to Bernard Rimland. There is actually very little in-depth coverage of this organization from secondary sources independent of the subject matter. Evidence of this is that the preponderance of sources in the article are either primary sources from ARI or secondary sources that discuss related issues (i.e. autism, vaccines, chelation therapy, etc) but give little to no discussion about ARI. The in-depth coverage alleged earlier in this discussion appears to be primarily a discussion of Rimland. "\r\n" I am the editor with a potential COI mentioned by user:FreeRangeFrog. I never put the page on my watchlist, so I\'m afraid I didn\'t notice the AfD discussion until just now. I did not realize that the Bernard Rimland page had buckets of poorly sourced promotion on the Autism Research Institute. So if/when the page is merged, I\'d suggest replacing the entire poorly-sourced/promotional ""Autism Research Institute"" section on his page and the promotional sentence before it with something neutral and sourced, such as ""He founded the Autism Society of America and the Autism Research Institute, which at-the-time advocated for alternative autism treatments.""(Source: The New York Times). "\r\n" I do not see any good source. I see no source which is talking about this organization, but only some sources talking about something else which talk a little about this organization alongside the main topic of discussion. "\r\n" Per MrBill3\'s sources, there is enough press and books to keep the article. "\r\n". A WP:FRINGE organisation, taking donations, therefore we should be suspicious that it is self-promoting for WP:ADVOCACY reasons. It is appropriately in Category:Pseudoscience. However, it exists, it is out there in reliable sources, readers will expect to find some coverage of it, and we do not censor pseudo-science. No strong opinion on the merge proposal, but probably it should be smerged if the opening paragraph can\'t be sourced to a reputable independent secondary source and the first reference is to be to quackwatch. --"\r\n". This organization describes a lot of medical practices that may fall under WP:FRINGE if editors don\'t pay attention to WP:MEDRS. That being said, there\'s many problems with this article right now, but it seems to satisfy WP:GNG "\r\n" -I agree that it is WP:FRINGE, however, i also think as many others do that this does in fact have plenty of reliable sources to support its remaining here on wikipedia.

Found some other coverage of him; 2. He was a candidate for the Greens Party in 2009 MLA for Surrey-Newton per 3. I found some coverage of him in his Weeve roll here and here. He is also involved in an notable lawsuit here 6, 7, 8, 9 against Trinity Western University, where it notes he is openly gay and the face of the lawsuit. Actual lawsuit details are here. I don\'t know the political situation in Canada, but in my own country being openly gay and holding political office adds to notability. In addition he is noted as by Maclean\'s magazine as someone of note to look out for in their ""Future Leaders of Canada"" spread. see here. I will work to put this all into the article if I can find time, but anyone else is encouraged to do so first in the meantime.

I think that it would probably just be better to WP:BOLDly redirect the other books to the series page as well, rather than take them all through AfD. Leaving the article history behind might be helpful in case any of them do pass notability guidelines in the future and it\'s usually fairly rare that anyone un-redirects an article enough times to really make an AfD necessary in most cases.

I\'m not proposing creating stubs on all $10,000 ITF events, just ones which are notable when played with the notable men\'s draws. They belong together, even if it is one tournament with two names.

"\r\n" - Okay, so I\'ve asked around and people seem to be across the board impressed by the hockey thing, but everything else in the article, opinions seem to vary. I would suggest that the article should be written like ""Nicholas Padfield is a former hockey play who was on the national team in 1986"" if that is the thing that makes him notable. Currently, the hockey thing is a sidenote. Secondly, I\'m unsure if being in Who\'s who is notable or not, but if that\'s the thing that makes him notable, it also should be noted in the article as opposed to simply being used as a reference. Also, I\'m not sure that that book can be used as a source for anything aside from the fact that he is in the book as well as minor biographical information. Currently almost the entire article is sourced to the Who\'s who entry, but the wikipedia entry for Who\'s who (UK) mentions that the entries are self-written, so it would be the same as citing someone\'s personal website. If reliable sources can be presented for him, I\'m willing to vote to keep. "\r\n""\r\n" - I\'d incline to regarding all QCs and all national-level sportspeople as notable, and he\'s been both. Who\'s Who (UK) is a good reliable corroboration, but getting in is not an achievement in itself. It\'s his sporting and legal achievements that are the basis of his notability. "\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n" If a topic has an article in a sufficiently highly regarded encyclopedia, biographical dictionary or similarly organised work of reference, that is sufficient evidence that that topic is notable. A & C Black\'s Who\'s Who is a publication that falls into that category. It has a reputation for only including people who are worthy of notice. Whilst we have not gotten round to writing a subject notability guideline for this yet (though one of them does have inclusion at reasonable length in standard works of reference as a criteria), I think that most editors would accept that inclusion via a dedicated article in this type of publication creates a presumption of notability.

This person is notable for his suicide note making a major difference; it exposed the VA\'s gross negligence, fraudulence, and disrespect of not only him, but many other veterans by the VA system. Although there had been previous whistleblowers at the Phoenix VA, none received significant public attention. The Arizona Republic quoted US Representative from Arizona Kyrsten Sinema: ""Daniel Somers is the original whistle-blower of the Phoenix VA"" (Friday, July 11, 2014, pages A1 and A16). His parents continue to press for systemic change in the VA system. For example, on Thursday, July 10, 2014, they testified before the US House Veterans\' Affairs Committee and proposed a number of specific reforms (http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/pdf/somers-family-testimony-hearing.pdf). His suicide note also led to whistle-blowers speaking out about other VA hospitals across the nation. The fraudulent ""secret lists"" were then exposed. These lists had been used to make it seem that VA facilities were meeting their goals for timeliness of appointments; this led to administrative staff receiving bonuses.\xe2\u20ac\u201d Preceding unsigned comment added by Bananagramwinner (talk \xe2\u20ac\xa2 contribs) Comment May I ask that participants in this discussion review the major changes made to the article yesterday and consider whether their !votes still stand as they are?

I\'m sorry I\'m dominating this discussion, but this subject became important to me through this process, and I am very interested in resolving it clearly and fairly, even if the clear consensus is to delete. It should now be clear that the sourcing for historical WP:PERSISTENCE is roughly as thorough as it is likely to get (assuming Bananagramwinner and I were also reasonably thorough - the ""first whistle-blower"" statement that Bananagramwinner found ties this in to the larger VA scandal of 2014), so if this doesn\'t cut it, then so be it. I have never participated in a discussion involving single-event notability or persistence, so I don\'t know if these newer sources have clearly established the case or made it clearer that, if this is all we get, then it fails one or both tests. Thank you again for your tremendous patience! "\r\n" but retitle to Suicide of Daniel Somers. 90% of what makes the subject notable is their whistleblowing attempts/actions agains the VA. Giving some preamble that explains the lead up to the suicide/note, but not as a Biography of Daniel Somers. "\r\n" and move. This suicide was obviously notable due to the impact it had on the VA. For that reason I don\'t think WP:BLP1E applies here. "\r\n". It appears to be quite clear that his political career came to nothing. The fact that the article is 6 years out of date, and unreferenced, is a cautionary tale against lowering the notability bar too far. --"\r\n". "\r\n" - I cannot find any evidence this person passes WP:GNG or WP:NPOL. -- "\r\n" Holder of a postion so minor, that it would not make him notable in any city."\r\n" - at present he fails to pass WP:POLITICIAN and, separately, there are not the sources required to meet WP:GNG.

"\r\n" This person fails the notability guidelines for politicians by a very large margin."\r\n". For those trying to decipher what the nominator means, ""deprodded"" apparently means removed a ""proposal for deletion"" (i.e. ""prod"") notice on an article. "\r\n". I could not find significant coverage of the subject itself in independent reliable sources. However, its articles have attracted reasonably significant coverage in reliable sources, which I think meets Wikipedia:Notability (web)\'s criterion that ""the content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."" While some of the coverage I considered is in opinion pieces, which are not reliable sources for factual purposes, their publication in high-profile reliable sources still seems indicative of the subject\'s notability. Some coverage considered:    Harbison, C. (2014-05-13). ""Football Player AJ McCarron Flaunts Sexual Orientation On Live Television: Free Wood Post Satire Article Has Internet In An Uproar"".

Breitbart.    There are also many cases where FW Post\'s works of fiction are carried as factual news, with the source unattributed, for example in this Ghana Nation story, although it\'s not clear that influencing world news media confers ""notability"" in the Wikipedia sense. \xe2\u20ac\u201c\xe2\u20ac\u201c"\r\n" Please add new comments below this notice.

Perhaps there is other coverage we don\'t have access to in old Amiga magazines or something, but unless properly documented, I would not presume notability.

None of the claims show sufficient notability. Wikipedia is WP:NOTMEMORIAL. I\'ve nominated his mentor, Pere Di Elbreil. "\r\n" -- 10,000 converts (even if in conjunction with another person); presidential gold medal. If correct, this sound like notability to me. The complaint does not seem to be that the content is inaccurate. I suspect the nom has an axe to grind, to remove notable Indian Christians nof an earlier generation. "\r\n""\r\n" - there is certainly a claim to notability for this person. That Thomas Rathnam is not notable is irrelevant in the context of this article, and we have to assume good faith when it comes to other editors and their motivations. Most of the references do not appear to be reliable sources (which is an entirely different thing from being ""bogus"") but there may very well be other usable references; I do not read Tamil so can\'t find sources in that language. Please note that references do not have to be online, but they (obvously) have to exist in some form. In the interest of counteracting systemic bias it is important to include notable people outside the Western world - provided they are notable. --"\r\n" Is this ""gold medal from the president of India"" a Presidential Gold Medal of India or something that we have an article on the award? Is there any evidence he received it? The 10,000 converts seems to be this man, the priest mentioned here, and maybe some others. Is there a reliable source covering conversions of the untouchables in India. I know in the mid-20th-century many of those left Hinduism for other religions in very large groups, enough that India has since tried to pass laws to discourage such, so in the context of the time and place 10,000 converts is not neccesarily that big a deal. I\'m sure there were Catholic missionaries in 15th-century Mexico who baptized many more Native people than that who we have no articles on. There are published books on the history of Christianity in both Asia and India specifically, I started reading one on the later when a student at Wayne State University, but never finished it. These might be good places to look to see if there are any mentions of Rathinam and his work in converting people. Tamil sources might also be helpful if they are findable."\r\n". The nomination is cryptic indeed, but there don\'t seem to be any English-language sources available online, nor any indication that offline or non-English sources exist. At the risk of stating the obvious, we can\'t really keep articles at AfD solely on the basis that they contain remarkable claims (e.g. having converted a large number of people or having received a certain award) \xe2\u20ac\u201c if those claims aren\'t verifiable, and in this case they don\'t seem to be, then they can\'t be used to establish notability. \xe2\u20ac\u201c "\r\n". Sources yet to be found. "\r\n". No sources. There also seems to be some hoaxing going on on the internet concerning this family; see the rather crude ""Mr. potato head"" style photofits on this page for instance and the repeated recreation of Thomas Rathnam, a supposed descendent. I don\'t doubt this is a real person but that isn\'t helping to find sources and means we need to be particularly vigilant about verification in this case. I have no idea what the Tamil script is saying in the article that is supposedly the Tamil version of his name (Google translate comes up with nothing intelligble), but the shear length of it makes it pretty certain that it does not say ""S.V.S. Rathinam"". From the cover of his book I summise that ""S.V.S.

This company routinely receives press in the Wisconsin area , here are three examples: http://www.jsonline.com/business/89368117.html  http://www.ibwisconsin.com/In-Business-Wisconsin/August-2012/SHINE-brings-a-light-of-hope-to-cancer-and-heart-patients/  http://host.madison.com/wsj/business/article_374ce040-d022-11df-bfd9-001cc4c002e0.html The company has grown to 30 employees and the technology they have developed is really cutting edge stuff. Their patents discuss gas-based IEC devices. These machines do nuclear fusion reactions which produce neutrons. PNL has developed some of the worlds best commercial neutron sources - 10^14 Neutrons per second is no joke. This technology puts them in a unique position to developed radioactive isotopes. These isotopes (like MOLY-99 or Mo-99) are very rare, and very expensive. They have been made in giant machines (such as particle accelerators) in the past, PNL has scaled down the size of these machines considerably. This gives their spin-off company: SHINE technologies, a very unique and exciting position in the market place. PNL is one the best examples of commercial applications of fusor devices. "\r\n""\r\n" as per Ukexpat. No evidence of corporate notability. "\r\n",Keep, I don\'t know much about this company, (not affiliated in any way, etc, etc), but Phoenix Nuclear Labs (PNL) and their partner SHINE medical technologies are routinely in the news, at least in southern WI, due to the process that they developed to produce MOLY-99 or Mo-99. Apparently the company SHINE was formed by several of the people involved with PNL to actually use the process they developed. The way it is portrayed in the Wisconsin State Journal is that they will build a plant near the airport in Janesville, WI and produce Mo-99, which has a halflife suitable for shipping, to be shipped to hospitals through out US who then use it to make isotopes with short halflives that are suitable for nuclear imaging. One of the issues mentioned in the newspaper is that the main source of this Mo-99 is a Canadian reactor that uses highly enriched uranium, but the PNL process doesn\'t use HEU, thus reducing the risk of proliferation, etc. Additionally, the Canadian reactor is supposedly shutting down in 2016 making this process even more important, at least that\'s what they claim to the press anyway. It seems to me that this is something that is notable, but I don\'t know where that process would be best covered on wikipedia or if an article about the lab is necessary. Nuclear medicine#Source of radionuclides, with notes on a few radiopharmaceuticals seems to cover some of this ground. --"\r\n" The jsonline source and external links to regional newspaper constitute significant coverage in multiple reliable independent sources.

I don\'t see a violation of NPOV: there is a lengthy section of criticism and responses. Although you say there is no uptake by serious scholars, the page cites 2 articles in scholarly journals, one of which is a review of this book, and Google Scholar claims 161 cites[2]. There\'s also a review in Education Review[3]. For me the only issue is whether it should be merged to Richard Lynn (whose article already includes a briefer discussion of the book) or kept; there maybe aren\'t enough sources yet to establish separate notability, and many sources seem to group together Lynn\'s ideas from multiple publications, so discussing them all at once makes sense. Remember, Wikipedia is WP:NOTCENSORED which means we don\'t delete discussion of ideas just because we find them distasteful. --"\r\n" A merge without redirect might be a good outcome here. I am intimately familiar with the research literature on this topic, and following the Google Scholar link you kindly shared, I see that many of those hits are to articles by the same few authors who are funded by the author\'s funding source or are hits by keyword coincidence and not specific citations to the book. (The book is unfortunately titled in that regard.) If other editors are interested as part of this AfD discussion, I could cite quite a few current reliable sources on the broader and narrower topics of the book to show that the book is not mentioned even by scholars who are surely aware of its existence and writing about the same topic in more recent years. Thank you for your prompt reply. -- WeijiBaikeBianji (talk, "\r\n""\r\n" Although I am not a personal fan of this book, this and this, I think, count as significant reviews, and thus it satisfies criteria one. Or am I missing something here? "\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n" What counts as ""independent"" reliable sources about the book? I see that the notability guideline for books asks us to look for books that have ""been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the book itself."" I don\'t think that has happened here. Moreover, the general notability guideline reminds Wikipedians to look for a topic that ""has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject"" when creating an article. Wikipedia is not a directory, and indeed a different crowd-sourced project is already attempting to have a webpage for every book. I ask, because there is a book, a reliable secondary source by a professional scholar published by a university press, that points out that many books by Richard Lynn are ""reviewed"" by reviewers who receive funding from the same ideological funding source that Lynn receives funding from. Below I will include a block quotation from the book (which, oddly, does not appear on Wikipedia with its own stand-alone article, even though it has many independent favorable reviews) to respond to another editor\'s question here about the reviews that Lynn\'s book has received.  In keeping with the Satterfield plan\'s desire for maximum publicity, the different projects supported by Pioneer often functioned in a nicely coordinated fashion, the fund\'s journals providing multiple sources of promotion for work done by the fund\'s scientists. Jensen\'s book, Straight Talk about Mental Tests, for example, received effusive praise in reviews in both the Mankind Quarterly and the Journal of Social, Political and Economic Studies. (However, true to Pearson\'s obsession with racial purity, in the former he complained that Jensen\'s discussion of racial differences in IQ considered the correlation between the test scores of blacks and their \'estimated degree of Caucasoid admixture\' but neglected the effects \'of black genes amongst segments of the population classified as white\'; the true racial difference was reduced not only by blacks whose \'white genes\' raised their IQs but by whites whose unrecognized \'black genes\' lowered theirs.) The reviews thus completed a convenient cycle in which Jensen, a scientist whose work was supported by Pioneer, wrote a book, which was then highly recommended in two journals whose publication was funded by Pioneer and finally sent gratis to college and university officials throughout the country by FHU, whose purchase and distribution of the books was also paid for by Pioneer. American Renaissance also joined with Pearson\'s journals in highlighting the work of Pioneer grantees. In 1997, for example, Richard Lynn published Dysgenics, arguing that the eugenicists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been correct in predicting the deterioration of Western civilization as a result of modern medical techniques and charitable assistance to the poor, which had combined to allow the transmission of \'defective\' genes and the reproduction of an underclass that was genetically less intelligent and less moral. Between AR and Pearson\'s two journals, the book was discussed at length four times, all these reviews agreeing that the West, burdened with its black population, was heading for a \'genetic dead end\' and certain that, as one reviewer put it, \'some sort of compensatory meddling will be required if human evolution is ever to return to its once healthy course.\' The most obscure works supported by Pioneer, unlikely to be noticed elsewhere, received much attention in these interlocking outlets. \xe2\u20ac\u201dWilliam H.

"\r\n" Inasmuch as Vanamonde93\'s and Colapeninsula\'s comments preceded the citation of a scholarly study of how books like the book under discussion gain multiple nonindependent reviews, all supported by the same funding source, are we sure it can be shown that ""multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the book itself"" have provided sufficient sourcing for an article about the book? -- WeijiBaikeBianji (talk, "\r\n" Simply because otherwise non-related reviews and publications might have had the same funding source and are possible part of a vast conspiracy to propagate scientific racism seems quite a stretch, and not the topic of this debate.

Just because the American Immigration Council and Amnesty International both receive funding from George Soros does not mean that they are invalid as sources just because they are both funded by him.

"\r\n""\r\n""\r\n""\r\n" I think there is a degree of IDHT being displayed at this page, as well as a tendency to confuse notability with being fringe. The fact that the book is very much fringe, and has been largely discredited, doesn\'t make it not notable; if anything, a book like this has greater need of a carefully neutral article than a more mainstream one. I don\'t believe neutrality is a criterion for reviews establishing notability; so long as they are non-trivial, which I believe them to be. \xe2\u20ac\u201d Preceding unsigned comment added by "\r\n" I concur, there seems to be much WP:IDONTLIKEIT here, there are topics on UFOs, psychics, even the Flat Earth Society.

To censor and withhold information simply because it is not mainstream is no better than supporting the material they purport as true.

I note for the record that some of the other editors participating in this discussion, namely Aprock and Maunus, are aware of a 2010 ArbCom case with several findings of editor misconduct (none applied to any of the editors commenting here so far) and ongoing discretionary sanctions. I\'m here to reality-check a recently contentious article to see if one of the reasons it is contentious is simply that it is much ado about an otherwise non-notable book. Editors here who commented on rationales for keeping the article helpfully suggested sources that can be used to improve it, and I can now tell that I have been much too stringent in my past evaluation of notability about books here on Wikipedia and may as well create a dozen or more new articles about books that are far more notable\xe2\u20ac\u201dand better works of scholarship besides. I may even need to revisit the issue of hiving off separate articles for articles about books that were merged out of sight in years before I became an active editor here. Where I come from on this issue is simply that I have been researching the topic with the resources of an enormous university library system at a university with an active research program on the topic for more than two decades, since long before Wikipedia existed. Gradually, especially since I read the ArbCom case file, I have begun to figure out why Wikipedia is so askew from the balance of points of view found in the professional literature. I will do my part to seek out sources impartially and with full regard to core Wikipedia policies and guidelines.

Thanks, "\r\n" Please add new comments below this notice. Thanks, "\r\n". It does technically meets the current standards for books , having received ""non-trivial"" reviews. This is in my opinion a very low standard, as a high percentage of non-self published fiction and all serious academic books get non-trivial reviews. Since that the actual standards are not very helpful, in practice we deal with notability concerns by arguing about the substantial or independent nature of the reviews--for almost all books brought here, including this one, I could argue these in either direction, and depend like most of us on our own intuitive sense of importance in the field. But Maunus has raised a much better criterion above which can be useful for controversial non-fiction, one which I think will often clarify discussions like this: the importance of the book in the author\'s overall work. Lynn\'s IQ and the wealth of nations has over 1200 holdings in Worldcat; this has about 120. Insignificant as part of his total work--apparently a rather routine recapitulation of his ideas. For controversial authors, attempts to make separate articles for each of their less important books amounts to promotional overemphasis.

"\r\n""\r\n" of the term ""Beyond the shadow of a doubt"" merits an article. Specific criticisms of the current state of an article are always of minor importance.  In my opinion the nomination\'s suggestion that the article be moved to the wiktionary is based on a mistake. The term is widely used in an ironic manner, with no meaningful association with jurisprudence. Educated people for whom English is a second language, may come across this term, over and over again, without ever realizing it is derived from jurisprudence. Here is an example where the term is used merely for emphasis, with no meaningful association with jurisprudence:         In fact, writes Coontz, the traditional family of the 1950s was a qualitatively new phenomenon. At the end of the 1940s, all the trends characterizing the rest of the twentieth century suddenly reversed themselves. This clear-eyed, bracing, and exhaustively researched study of American families and the nostalgia trap proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Leave It to Beaver was not a documentary.         Here is an example where the term is used by neuropsychologists, theoretically discussing the mechanism behind the subjective feeling of certainty:         In fact, when validity represents the over-riding concern, individuals may be motivated to postpone closure and, in extreme cases, to avoid it altogether. This is not inevitable, however: If a particular closure appears valid beyond the shadow of a doubt (e.g., because of the impeccable credibility of its source), the fear of invalidity may increase the tendency to embrace it rather than prompting its avoidance or postponement. Thus, closure avoidance should be conceptually distinguished from the fear of invalidity. Although closure avoidance may be often induced by such fear, this may not hold invariably.         Here is an example from nuclear physics that addresses the slim theoretical possibility that a side effect of building and using even higher powered atom smashers may trigger the disintegration of planet Earth -- again, a usage that has nothing to do with jurisprudence:         We pose the question of whether one can, on the basis of established facts, exclude beyond the shadow of a doubt the \xe2\u20ac\u0153BNL doomsday scenario\xe2\u20ac\x9d         So, in my opinion, the article should be retained.

"\r\n""\r\n" If you find an entry in a list which you do not feel belongs, you can tag it as needing a reliable source identifying it as a cultural icon, or you can be bold and remove it. We do not require laser sharp objective definitions for list membership. The fact that reliable sources say something is a cultural icon of a country is sufficient. It is a red herring to argue that the lists say there are ""encyclopedic connections between all the icons"" when no such claim is made. They are just individually identified as cultural icons. When someone adds vanispamcruft items with no refs calling them ""cultural icons"" or equivalent, , anyone else is welcome to remove them. "\r\n" ""When no such claim is made""... then why compile a list? Each of these lists accomodates anyone and anything that has ever been called a ""cultural icon"" \xe2\u20ac\u201c a term which can be fairly described as a recentism with considerable promotional value and a controversial definition. The term is not uncommon to find, but it is not used purposefully enough in actual literature to be considered an encyclopedic topic. These lists will always be viewed as contests or rankings, and they will always be incomplete. Each source is specific to one particular entry and wholly unrelated to all the others: they don\'t add up to a convincing sum. I have never seen a broad survey of ""\'cultural icons\' of France"" (or any other country) that could be considered scholarly, and it\'s no accident that the sparse sourcing on these lists comes from fan websites, popular magazines and travel guides. Without a compelling reason to exist, they are WP:INDISCRIMINATE collections and attempts to stitch them together, however sincere, are ultimately WP:OR. "\r\n" But, sadly, you are quite wrong and your arguments are not well conceived in this instance. Books, movies, tv shows, magazine articles and travel guides concur that numerous countries have numerous ""cultural icons"" known not only to everyone in the country but to educated persons worldwide. They are the things, persons, and places one thinks of when one thinks of the country. Your comment suggests that there would be neither agreement in France nor in other countries as what things characterize France, and that there would be no commonality in naming Notre Dame, Paris,the Louvre, the Left Bank, or the wine country. Please get it through your head that things cited to reliable sources are not original research. "\r\n""\r\n" per Edison.

You are right, there is no guideline saying that sources for articles about software should actually cover software. Usage numbers are a good point to note, but they don\'t really say anything about the software: regardless numerous noted usage statistics, this article does not provide encyclopedic coverage of application whatsoever; it does not even provide a way to distinguish this application from any other software in its genre.

You might be right. A WP:AfD discussion would certainly be quite justified. Article\'d probably be kept is my guess, on the basis of a New York Times article and totality of the other refs, plus his status as the only person in the Western Hemisphere on the (what I think is still the most current) Committee to Protect Journalists list. You never know, though. You also have a WP:BLP argument in that, although I tried to be evenhanded, there\'s really no way to avoid Shuler coming off kind of badly in some respects, notwithstanding being a martyr of sorts, and you could make the case that at the end of the day he\'s just an idiosyncratic private citizen and doesn\'t deserve to be exposed to public scrutiny in the world\'s most popular encyclopedia. There\'s also the issue of ""Rileys\'s son"" and the ""the woman""; although I didn\'t name them, I suppose it\'d certainly be possible to find their names somewhere (certainly for the former), and an article here greatly increases the visibility of the (certainly salacious and, according to a judge, defamatory) claim about two completely private citizens, and it\'d be hard to have the article make sense if you redact that material. So, reasonable WP:BLP case on those grounds also.  On the other hand, it\'s not just a oddball-criminal human interest story. There\'s First Amendment aspects which the New York Times noted and the argument could be made that that makes it of encyclopedic value if you\'re looking into application of law in that area in 21st century America.  UPDATE: The case was unsealed, so the original complaint is public record and so it is indeed fairly easy to get the name of the the plaintiffs for anyone who cares to. Also, he was released in March, to little mainstream press notice that I could find right off. An arrest warrant has recently been issued for him and from there the trail goes cold. Any road, the case is probably over and the relative lack of mainstream notice of the end of the case would be another possible point. "\r\n""\r\n""\r\n" Please add new comments below this notice.

The sources given above are negligible and almost all primary. Multiple independent reliable sources are needed for notability. "\r\n". Apart from \'Edinburgh\' (which may be used for Waris Hasan\'s academic qualification and then as such valid), most other links are publication of repute who are using Waris Hasan\'s work as reference, hence, they are secondry/tertiary sources which are using his work for reference, hence, establishing reputation of Waris Hasan\'s work and in turn proving acceptability of Waris Hasan as important persomn in academic circles. As pointed above by an IP, Waris Hasan is one of the contributors of Shi\'ite Islam, an important text on the history and thought of Shi\'a Islam (he is co-author of Chapter 4 The Shi\'i Interpretation of Hadith Literature), if a book is accepted as important in academic circle then by default prooves caliber and status of author(s)/contributor(s). Waris Hasan was most of time active in Iraq where he spent his time with likes of Allamah Tabatabai and later part of his life wast spent in India (in interim he was in UK at Edinburgh) so it is likely that he may not have much coverage in western media but that doesn\'t reduces his notablity, and he was principal of two major instututions in Lucknow viz. Madarsatul Waizeen (Shia Islamic Seminary, one of the oldest and most important in India) and Shia College (around hundred years old Post Graduate Degree College providing Secular Education including B.Sc, M.Sc, B.A, M.A, B.B.A, M.B.A, B.C.A, M.C.A, etc) that too is proof of his academic brillaince and acceptability in academic circles (both religious & Secular) of Lucknow.

Of course since Wayne County has approximately 2 million people it is a different story, and Ficano gets lots of coverage, much of it negative. Kym Worthy has not had many nice things to say about Ficano, for example. That said, the article on May has a vast lack of sourcing, DeKalb County is not equivalent to Wayne County, maybe more Mark Hackel or L. Brooks Patterson level, the executives of the two main suburban counties in Metro Detroit. Though I would say the Patterson article is weak, giving too much attention to an incident early this year when Patterson was attacked for an out-of-context quote from about 1980. The fact that Patterson has been County Executive for 22 years, and was County Prosecutor for 16 before that and before that took a major case to the Supreme Court make him very different than May who actually is only an interim county executive."\r\n" At best notable for one event.

There were also posts on several blogs including Salt Lake Tribune blog by Peggy Fletcher Stack (although the ""letter"" isn\'t really the focus of the story), FairMormon Blog (Jeff Lindsay (engineer)), Rational Faiths (Brian C.

Overall, it\'s not much for reliable sources, mostly just online blogs and the like, no print sources that I can find.

"\r\n" IMO this doesn\'t satisfy the ""significant coverage"" criteria of WP:GNG, which means at this point it is extremely difficult to make this any more than a summary-only description of the work.

His results on Scholar show that his publications get a reasonable number of citations, even after excluding those papers concerned with P!=NP. I make his Scholar derived h-index to be 11, which is quite respectable, especially given that a lot of mathematics journals aren\'t indexed by Scholar. This probably makes him marginally notable by WP:PROF, and that together with the excitement generated by the N!=NP paper makes him definitely notable to my mind. However, the problem here is the lack of biographical information. If the only information we have on him is his work on the P/NP problem his article is going to say no more than is already said in our P versus NP problem article. Even a search of the HP Labs site does not turn up a bio. I suspect that means that there isn\'t a usable bio anywhere. "\r\n""\r\n".

A few sentences about his incorrect proof in P versus NP problem are sufficient here. GoogleScholar usually gives an over count when computing h-index, and in any case an h-index of 11 for Computer Science is pretty low, certainly not enough to pass WP:Prof#C1. "\r\n". It doesn\'t help that his name is spelled wrong here; it should be Deolalikar. Anyway, he has one reasonably well cited and well received paper, ""Sparse Indexing: Large Scale, Inline Deduplication Using Sampling and Locality"", and one major embarrassment (the attempted proof of P vs NP). I don\'t think the citation record (in a high citation field) is enough for WP:PROF and I think per WP:BLP we should lean towards not including the embarrassment unless it has more lasting significance than I think this one does. \xe2\u20ac\u201d"\r\n" in the absence of independent reliable sources about the person. Without reliable sources to draw on we simply cannot write an article about anything or anyone. So far we have sources only for the claim of having resolved the P versus NP problem.

Building the content in a dedicated article is a practical solution. As Ketil says ""Better to collect details here for now, and merge/delete later"". Regarding the \'massacre\' label, it\'s not important but it is something that editors must deal with. Many years of editing in the ARBPIA topic area tells me that this will only be a contentious issue for supporters of the belligerents and there\'s really nothing unusual about a significant proportion of RS and commentators applying a massacre label to an event in this conflict (see List_of_massacres_in_Israel for example).

Have you looked at the numbers from the recent killings in Syria, Iraq, etc. Why are those battles and massacres, in which far more people were killed, and, in the case of the massacres, clear massacres that nobody disputes, not notable and this one is? --"\r\n". They are not notable because they are not reported, except by cursory allusions en passant. 600,000 people are abducted or kidnapped every year, and by your \'logic\', this means every listed article in List of kidnappings should be deleted, as relatively unnotable, to cite one of several dozens immediate answers to your poor analogy. The subtextual or interlinear innuendo in this kind of objection can often strike a reader like myself as suggesting there is something unusual (Israel-obsessed = antisemitic) in focusing on anything Israel does, when it is nothing in regional terms. It is a dismissive device in official government handouts to raise precisely this objection (meaning, go away and look at what is happening in Sudan if you find killing Palestinian children every other week objectionable and wish to maintain your credibility as impartial). In simple analogical terms, it\'s like saying: \'Hey, why print that I shot someone? Tens of thousands of people are shot everyday all over the world\'. All things that are extensively covered by RS, like the 2014 Chibok kidnapping are written up here, in the face of the fact that, say in Kyrgyzstan, one half of the female population is subject to abduction and forced marriage, making it a massive daily event, but hardly ever reported, and therefore not RS unless the phenomenon becomes the subject of international attention and journalistic/academic study."\r\n" I never made any personal allegations.

And considering the size of the australian industry and the number of awards given out at the ARIAs, it\'s not surprising he has some nominations. The way the current article is written, it talks up his achievements far more than the references support. At the very least this article needs a major triage back to the facts, removal of all the original research (seemingly written by Kosky himself) and a more sensible tabular format with fully reference credits. As it is, it appears as though Kosky is using wikipedia as his resume & media relations outlet. "\r\n" subject has at least three ARIA noms per refs just added. Only one nom is needed to meet WP:BAND Criterion#6 and hence obtain sufficient notability for an article.

I also disagree strongly that being nominated for an ARIA award is an indicator of notability; these days you can pick up a nomination along with a burger and shake at the drive-thru.

What comes through in many of the articles is the understanding that IMVBox is fighting a longstanding problem in Iran: online piracy. There is a view, I think, that IMVBox is revolutionising Iranian cinema. It is after all the first time Iranian films have been gathered together on one website. Before IMVBox\xe2\u20ac\u2122s creation Iranian films were available on many websites for illegal download.

I am also disappointed about the discussion here which seems to be deprecating having an article because the term ""ludic fallacy"" may only be used in the popular press. If this were true (and it is not[20]) it might be a reason to make extra efforts to have a responsible article so that intelligent, interested readers can look up a description of the concept and so be better able to assess whatever journalese they are reading and whether the concept itself has any validity. If the present article is ""extremely wanting""[21] I would recommend improving it. Whether it should be merged with The Black Swan (2007 book) is of lesser importance.
